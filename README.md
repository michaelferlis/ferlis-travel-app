# Fly Away
As an avid traveler, I designed and developed Fly Away with the idea of simplifying travel for everyone. The application gives users the ability to better organize pertinent travel information during the planning process as well as on their trips.

In addition, Fly Away acts as a trip journal that users can refer back to remember and relive their amazing experiences away from home. Using Google Maps API, users are also able to mark locations all over the world that they have visited.



# Setup Instructions

Fly Away uses React, Redux, Express, Passport, and PostgreSQL (a full list of dependencies can be found in `package.json`).


* Run `npm install`
* Start postgres if not running already by using
* Run `npm run server`
* Run `npm run client`
* Navigate to `localhost:3000`
